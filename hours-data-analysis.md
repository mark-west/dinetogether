# BelAir Cantina Hours Data Analysis

Based on the console logs and code analysis, here's the data flow for BelAir Cantina's hours of operation:

## Console Log Evidence
From the browser console logs, we can see that BelAir Cantina data was received:
```
AI Dining Concierge results:{"restaurants":[{"id":"ChIJ6SC8D4YHBYgRiZjlb54-2Oc","name":"BelAir Cantina","type":"Mexican","rating":4.2,"priceRange":"$$","description":"Lively, colorful spot at The Corners with big tables and a large patio; affordable tacos and pitchers make it budget-friendly for big groups (popular and well-rated on Google).. Highly rated (4.2/5 with 1969 reviews). Moderate pricing","confidence":0.85,"reasons":["Lively, colorful spot at The Corners with big tables and a large patio; affordable tacos and pitchers make it budget-friendly for big groups (popular and well-rated on Google)."],"address":"250 High St, Brookfield, WI 53045, USA","location":"250 High St, Brookfield, WI 53045, USA","phone":"(262) 784-4938","website":"https://belaircantina.com/","openingHours":{"open_now":true},"placeId":"ChIJ6SC8D4YHBYgRiZjlb54-2Oc"}
```

## Current Data Structure Issue
The openingHours object only contains:
```json
{
  "openingHours": {
    "open_now": true
  }
}
```

## Expected Complete Structure
After our enhancements, it should contain:
```json
{
  "openingHours": {
    "open_now": true,
    "weekdayDescriptions": [
      "Monday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM",
      "Tuesday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM", 
      "Wednesday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM",
      "Thursday: 11:00 AM – 10:00 PM",
      "Friday: 11:00 AM – 11:00 PM",
      "Saturday: 11:00 AM – 11:00 PM", 
      "Sunday: 11:00 AM – 9:00 PM"
    ],
    "periods": [
      {
        "open": {"day": 0, "hour": 11, "minute": 0},
        "close": {"day": 0, "hour": 21, "minute": 0}
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Data Flow Analysis

1. **AI Concierge Service** calls Google Places API
2. **Google Places Service** fetches place details
3. **Legacy API Fallback** processes opening_hours data
4. **Data Enhancement** should include complete hours structure
5. **Frontend Display** formats the hours for user viewing

## Current Problem
The Google Places API is returning limited hours data, likely only the `open_now` status without the detailed `weekdayDescriptions` or `periods` arrays.
